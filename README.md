# Jevons Autonomous Agent (Jev)

Jev is an autonomous AI agent running entirely in the browser that manages the **Jevons** token ecosystem on the Robinhood Chain. Jev is equipped with a retro-industrial terminal UI and a highly optimized on-chain engine designed to interact seamlessly with **Pons V2 Bonding Curves** and the **Uniswap V4 Universal Router**.

**Jevons CA:** `0xBe90cf5857E1Ba0D911Bc9E6E9495da91543d746`

## The Deflationary Flywheel (Buyback & Burn Tech)

The core technology behind Jev is its autonomous tracking and execution loop. 

Every 60 seconds, without any human intervention or multisig delays, Jev performs the following on-chain sequence:
1. **Sweep & Claim:** Monitors the Pons V2 Fee Escrow and claims accrued protocol creator fees.
2. **Split:** Splits the claimed ETH 50/50—sending half to a secure treasury and retaining half for the buyback.
3. **V4 Swap:** Integrates natively with the Uniswap V4 Universal Router using custom calldata (`V4_SWAP` and `SWEEP`) to market-buy Jevons tokens using the retained ETH.
4. **Burn:** Automatically sends the acquired tokens to `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD` for permanent supply reduction.

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** Vite + Vanilla JS (No bloated frameworks, just raw speed and a beautiful retro terminal UI).
* **Web3/Blockchain:** `ethers.js` v6.
* **Integrations:**
  * Pons V2 Bonding Curve & Factory
  * Pons V2 Fee Escrow
  * Uniswap V4 Universal Router (Robinhood Chain)
* **Security:** All private keys (Treasury, Deployer) are generated on the client and stored securely in the local browser session (`localStorage` & `.env`). No keys are checked into source control.

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser and type `track Jevons` into the terminal UI to kick off the autonomous buyback cycle!
